 - PUT (small/medium/large) resources
 - GET (small/medium/large) resources
 - DELETE
* Namespace management:
 - MKCOL
 - COPY single resource/collection
 - MOVE single resource/collection
* Locking

1. Installation from Source
   - From CVS you need this:	
       	-- Need autoconf 2.51 or later version.
	-- Run autogen.sh to generate configure script
   	-- (
           On a RedHat 7.3 system there are two versions of autoconf
    	   installed.  Sadly, the old one is the default.  You'll need to
    	   tell autogen which autoconf scripts to run:

    	   AUTOHEADER=autoheader-2.53 AUTOCONF=autoconf-2.53 ./autogen.sh 
   	   )
   - Get Prestan-x-x-x.tar.gz.
   - Untar 
   - configure; make; make install
   - Set --with-debug when you do configure to see debug info.
   - If you compile Prestan with debug option, 
     it is NOT running as a daemon mode for debugging convenience.
